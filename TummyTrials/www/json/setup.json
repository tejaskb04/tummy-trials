We realize that these may not include the trigger foods you have read about or would want to test right now but this is still work in progress. We appreciate your patience and welcome your suggestions for future IBS trigger foods to test. \n\nOver time, many people with IBS may have already discovered some of their IBS trigger foods, either through trial-and-error or with the help of a dietitian or their physician. If you already know that certain food trigger your IBS symptoms, we do not recommend selecting that food group for self-experimentation. Similarly, if you already know certain “safe foods” (foods that do not trigger your IBS symptoms), we do not recommend selecting that food group for self-experimentation. Instead, we recommend using the self-experimentation process to test foods that you are unsure of as one of your trigger or safe foods.\n\nSince things are always changing inside our body and environment, a food you once thought was a “safe food” may come into question in the future. In this situation, it may be appropriate to re-test it to determine if it is still a “safe food.” Similarly, a food you once thought was a “trigger food” may come into question in the future. In this situation, it may be appropriate to re-test it to determine if it is still a 'trigger food.'"
